Title: Counting Organizations

Developed an application using Python and SQLite to read and process unstructured mailbox data (mbox.txt). Extracted and counted email messages per organization (based on the domain name of the email address) and stored the results in a structured database.
The goal was to automate the extraction and organization of unstructured email data by domain, enabling efficient tracking and analysis of communication patterns across different organizations.
